# UCSD CSE Courses Comprehensive Review Docs

This repository includes all the review docs/cheatsheets we created during our journey in UCSD's CSE coures. 
We carefully summarized the important concepts, lecture slides, past exames, homework, piazza questions,
textbooks and all available resources. We integrated them togther here. 

### Purpose
This project intend to help UCSD students get better grades in these CS coures. We sincerely hope that
combining these review materials with your current course podcast, homework, etc. can help you achieve
excellence in your courses. Furthermore, this project serves as a "refer-to" place 
when we prepares for our career upon graduation. 

### Let us show off a little bit..
We got all A/A+ in these coureses, and in most of these courses we ranked top 10 or 20 in the entire 300 students class.
For instance, I ranked the 1st (out of 300) in Gary's CSE110 and 8th (out of 180) in Vianu's CSE132A. I felt
these review docs helped me a lot. My current overall GPA is 3.97/4.0.

### Important Notes:
* Some earilier doc's formats are poor, but they improved a lot as we progress into our junior/senior year.
* Review Docs are most useful when you are taking the same class from the same instructor; but the general content are the same even for different instructors, so you may also find them helpful.
* Posting homework, exams, quizzes sometimes violates academic integrity, so we decided not to post any.
* Course material may subject to copyright of the original instructor.
