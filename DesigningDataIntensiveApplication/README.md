# Designing Data Intensive Applications

## General

This folder includes my study note of an acclaimed book on **system design**: *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*, by *Marin Kleppmann*. It's one of the best books that discuss about designing a software system at scale. It covers a wide range of topics and synthesizing many of the great ideas and practices in the industry.

System design is very important. Even for a new grad. An increasingly number of interviews begin to ask about these questions. However, it's almost not covered in our curriculum, though some fundamentals has been taught in separate courses like operating system or database. 

We sure can learn about system design in our internships or jobs. Or watch a series of online videos on this subject. Or read couple of scattered blogs or articles from different sources. Nonetheless, nothing compares to reading an up-to-data, comprehensive, and well-written textbook. With the foundation established by this book, you will have a completely different perspective, a more general, robust one, towards any software that deals with data. 

This study note will continue to be updated, as I'm still reading and digesting its information.

## Content Summary

An application is data-insensive if data is its primary challenge: the quantity of data, the complexity of data, or the speed at which it is changing, as opposed to *compute-intensive*, where CPU cycles are the bottlenneck. 

This book help us navigate the diverse and fast-changing landscape of technologies for processing and storing data. It's neither a pratical tutorial for a certain tool nor a dry theoritical textbook. Instead, it looks at examples of successful data systems: technology that form the foundation of many popular applications and that have to meet **scalability**, **performance**, and **reliability** requirements in production every day. 

We will try to find useful ways of *thinking about* data systems: not just how they work, but also *why* they work that way, and what questions we need to ask. After reading this book, you will be in good position to decide which technology is appropriate for which purpose, and understand how tools can be combined to form the foundation of a good application architecture.

## Who should read this book

- You want to make data systems scalable, for example, to support web or mobile apps with millions of users.
- You need to make applications highly available (minimizing downtime) and operationally robust.
- You are lookin gfor ways of making ysstems easier to maintain in the long run, even as they grow and as requirements and technologies change.
- You have a natural curiosity for the way things work and want to know that goes on inside major websites and online services. This book breaks down the internals of various databases and data processing systems, and it's great fun to explore the bright thinking that went into their design.
